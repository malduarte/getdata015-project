# Running the script
- Clone this [repository](https://github.com/malduarte/getdata015-project)
- Run `Rscript run_analysis.R`
- The tidy dataset should get created in the current directory as `tidy.txt`
- Code book for the tidy dataset is available [here](CodeBook.md)


# Assumptions
- You have a working internet connection or a file named "getdata-projectfiles-UCI HAR Dataset.zip" in the same directory as the script.
- If you don't have the [file](http://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip), the script will download it for you
- There is no need to uncompress the zip file, the script decompresses it as needed, avoiding wasting storage space
